how to run:
python3.6 ors.py --file <SBS_file_name> --sheet <sheet_name> --output <statistics_output_file_name>

That script loads the xlsx,
calculates for every client his RCI.
RCI is diff of (3 first sessions ors avg) and (3 last sessions ors avg).

If the ORS value is null, skip to the next session.
If client has les then 3 sessions, RCI is 'N/A'.
